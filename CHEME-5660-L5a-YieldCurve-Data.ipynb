    "## The Yield Curve\n",
    "A yield curve is a line that plots yields, or interest rates, of bonds that have differing maturity dates. The slope of the yield curve can predict future interest rate changes and economic activity. There are three main yield curve shapes: normal upward-sloping curve, inverted downward-sloping curve, and flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Normal curves point to economic expansion__. A normal yield curve shows low yields for shorter-maturity bonds and then increases for bonds with a longer maturity, sloping upwards. \n",
    "* __Downward-sloping curves point to economic recession__. An inverted yield curve slopes downward, with short-term interest rates exceeding long-term rates. Such a yield curve corresponds to periods of economic recession, where investors expect yields on longer-maturity bonds to trend lower in the future.\n",
    "* __Flat yield curves point to an uncertain future__. A flat yield curve reflects similar yields across all maturities, implying an uncertain economic situation."
