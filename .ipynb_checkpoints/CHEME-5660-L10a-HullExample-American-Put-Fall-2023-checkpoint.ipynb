    "## Example: `Hull` American `put` Option Premium Calculation\n",
    "A binomial lattice model assumes that at each discrete time increment, the state of the system, e.g., the share price of equity, can either increase by a factor $u$ with probability $p$ or decrease by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ in the next time interval. Thus, each discrete time interval can be modeled as a [Bernoulli random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution):\n",
